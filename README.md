# rancoin
The project has the following features:-
1. Transferring and receiving of funds between different wallets is simulated using 3 dummy nodes with Postman API.
2. Created an immutable chain of blocks, each block is connected to the previous block(with a SHA256 Hash).
3. Mining of a new block is implemented by including a list of pending transactions and performing Proof of Work(POW).
4. Implemented the consensus algorithm where in case of conflict between nodes the longer chain survives.
5. Created an Initial Coin Offering(ICO) of rancoin which can be accessed using the MyEtherWallet interface.
